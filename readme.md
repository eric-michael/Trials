# Disposable Crap

This is a sample project to get off the ground with GitKraken, Node, Express, and MongoDB. It was developed by Travis and Tyler, with assistance from Bowser.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
[Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Check your version.

```
node --version
```

From the project folder in the command line, run the server.js file

```
node server
```

Visit [localhost:3000](localhost:3000) and you should see it running.
For fun, try the /hello or /bye routes.

## Built With

* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) - The server-side language
* [Express](https://github.com/expressjs/express) - Routing
* [Atom](https://atom.io/) - Text editor
* [Teletype](https://teletype.atom.io/) - Real-time code collaboration that didn't suck
* [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) - GUI for git-based version control
