# Disposable Crap

This is a sample project to get off the ground with GitKraken, Node, Express, and MongoDB. It was developed by Travis and Tyler, with assistance from Bowser.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
[Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Check your version to ensure you have Node installed.

```
~/ $ node --version
~/ $ v8.9.4
```

Make a node_modules folder in your project folder

```
~/Trials $ npm init
```

Run server.js using the 'node' command (.js extension optionally omitted)

```
~/Trials $ npm start
```

From there, visit your [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and you should see it running.
For fun, try the /hello or /bye routes.

## Built With

* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) - The server-side language
